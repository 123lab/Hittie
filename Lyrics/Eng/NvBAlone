You, you gonna break my heart
You gonna tear it apart
No matter what you do
I still be there for you
And when you call my name
I wonÂ´t be far away
No matter where you go
You never be alone, be alone, be alone
Now you never be alone, be alone, be alone
Now you never be alone, be alone, be alone
Now you never be alone, be alone, be alone
Will you never be alone, be alone, be alone
Now you never be alone, be alone, be alone
Now you never be alone, be alone, be alone
Now you never be alone, be alone, be alone
Will you never be alone, be alone, be alone
Now you never be alone, be alone, be alone
Now you never be alone, be alone, be alone
Now you never be alone, be alone
You, you gonna break my heart
You gonna tear it apart
No matter what you do
I still be there for you
