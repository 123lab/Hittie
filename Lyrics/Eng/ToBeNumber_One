To be number one 
Official Song Of Fifa World Cup Italy 90 

This is what we've worked for all our lives 
Reaching for the highest goal we can 
We choose to give it all 

When competition calls 
Time records the victory in our hearts 
To win or lose is not the only thing 
It's all in how we play for the fairest game 
This is the chance we take 
Reaching for the top 
Time records the victory in our hearts 

To be number one... 
Running like the wind 
(Like the wind) 
Playing hard but always playing fair 
(Oh yeah...) 

To be number one... 
Winning again and again 
Reaching higher through Italian sky 
(Through Italian sky) 

This is what we've wanted all our lives 
Shining like a shooting star at night 
We've got to give it all 
When we hear the call 
Time records the victory in our hearts 

To be number one... 
To be number one...number one
