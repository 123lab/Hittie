[Intro]
Come and fly away with me
Come and fly away with me-e-e-e-e
Come and fly away with me
Co-co-come and fly away with me-e-e-e-e-e-e

[Intro]
Come and fly away with me
Come and fly away with me-e-e-e-e
Come and fly away with me
Co-co-come and fly away with me-e-e-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Build]
Don’t you be afraid
Everything will change
You and I
Jumping off the edge
They say dreamers never die

[Build]
So, come and fly
Come and fly
Come and fly away with me

[Chorus]
We’re rising, we’re falling
We’ll make it through
We’re climbing, we’re soaring
A thousand views

[Distorted Chorus]
We’re rising, we’re falling
We’ll make it through
We’re climbing, we’re soaring
A thousand views

[Verse 2]
Somewhere by the emerald sea
Where the moon and water meet
Somewhere close to harmony
When the world is sound asleep

[Verse 3]
Something's gonna bring a change
Journeys we are meant to take
Something at the edge of space
Calling us to fly away

[Pre-Build]
Don’t you be afraid
Everything will change
You and I
Jumping off the edge
They say dreamers never die

[Build]
So, come and fly
Come and fly
Come and fly away with me

[Chorus]
We’re rising, we’re falling
We’ll make it through
We’re climbing, we’re soaring
A thousand views

[Distorted Chorus]
We’re rising, we’re falling
We’ll make it through
We’re climbing, we’re soaring
A thousand views

[Break]
Come and fly away
Come and
Come and fly away
Come and fly away with me

[Break]
Come and fly away
Come and
Come and fly away
Come and fly away with me

[Verse 3 - Outro]
Something's gonna bring a change
Journeys we are meant to take
Something at the edge of space
Calling us to fly away
