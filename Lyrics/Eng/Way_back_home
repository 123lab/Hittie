I'm helplessly needless and needless to say I owe you.
I'm helplessly needless and needless to say I owe you.

Well I'd wade ten thousand klicks for a just one more chance.
Just one more chance, to see your face again.

Well I'd pull, 10 time the weight of the earth with my teeth.
The earth with my teeth to touch your face alive.

You lie helplessly still as your face falls apart.
You lie helplessly still as your face falls apart.

With wax and wires and hair from the back of your head.
With wax and wires and hair from the back of your head.

Well I can make your face brand new.
Well I can make your face brand new.

La la la da da da da da da da daaaa
la la da da da da da da da da daaaa

You are warm.
You are warm.

Come take my hand and I'll take your hand,
And I will bring you out.
Come take the line and I'll take the line,
And I will pull you out.

To swing In the sun.

Come take my hand and I'll take your hand,
And I will bring you out.
Come take the line and I'll take the line,
And I will pull you out.

To swing In the sun.
swing in the sun.
swing in the sun.
