Now it's time to dance
The discoteque is far, but i can hear the rhythm
So now i stop my car
I'm going to the bar
And finally start
Dancing all around
Please, take my hands
And bring me to the moon
we're flying together
you make me feel so fine
and now i'm gonna tell you
you are the only one 
i wanted tonight

it's the power of pleasure
the power of dance
to the disco 
on the dancefloor
so welcome to my life
if you wanna move
this is time to make a party

it's the power of pleasure
the feeling i need
to the disco
on the dancefloor
so welcome to my life
if you wanna move
this is time to make a party
